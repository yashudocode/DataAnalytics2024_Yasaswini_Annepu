#using the prune.tree() function

# Using the importance() function, we can view the importance of each variable.
importance (rf.boston)
# Two measures of variable importance are reported.
#The former is based upon the mean decrease of accuracy in predictions on 
# the out of bag samples when a given variable is excluded from the model. 
#The latter is a measure of the total decrease in node impurity that results
# from splits over that variable, averaged over all trees.

# In the case of regression trees, the node impurity is measured by the training RSS,
# and for classification trees by the deviance.
# Plots of these importance measures can be produced using the varImpPlot() function.
